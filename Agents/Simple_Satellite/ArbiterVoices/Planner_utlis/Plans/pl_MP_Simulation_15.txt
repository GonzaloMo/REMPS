Post filtering unreachable actions: 
(image_score img1) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img2) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img3) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img4) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img5) has a finite lower bound: [0.000,inf]
(total_score) has a finite lower bound: [0.000,inf]
Have identified that bigger values of (total_score) are preferable
Seeing if metric is defined in terms of task vars or a minimal value of makespan
- Yes it is
Recognised a monotonic-change-induced limit on -1.000*var4(image_score img5)
- Must be >= -7.000
50% of the ground temporal actions in this problem are compression-safe
Initial heuristic = 5.000, admissible cost estimate nan
