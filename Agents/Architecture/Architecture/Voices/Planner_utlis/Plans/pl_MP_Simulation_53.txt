Have identified that bigger values of (total_score) are preferable
Seeing if metric is defined in terms of task vars or a minimal value of makespan
- Yes it is
Recognised a monotonic-change-induced limit on -1.000*var2(image_score img3)
- Must be >= -1.000
Recognised a monotonic-change-induced limit on var2(image_score img3)
Internal error - must only have > or >= limits here
