Post filtering unreachable actions: 
(image_score img1) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img2) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img3) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(image_score img4) has a finite lower bound: [0.000,inf]
(image_score img5) has finite bounds: [0.000,0.000]
(total_score) has a finite lower bound: [0.000,inf]
Have identified that bigger values of (total_score) are preferable
Seeing if metric is defined in terms of task vars or a minimal value of makespan
- Yes it is
Recognised a monotonic-change-induced limit on -1.000*var2(image_score img3)
- Must be >= -2.000
Recognised a monotonic-change-induced limit on var2(image_score img3)
Internal error - must only have > or >= limits here
