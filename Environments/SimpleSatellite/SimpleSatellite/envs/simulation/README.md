# SimpleSatellite Simulation

## Base Simulation
The base simulation is a simulation of a satellite orbiting the earth. The satellite has a limited amount of energy, and can perform actions to conserve energy.

## Simulation versions
### V0
In this version the simulation finishes when the satellite achieves all goals, and charges if an action is not being taken.

### V1
In this version the simulation has a fixed number of orbits, and charges if an action is not being taken

### V2
In this version the simulation has a fixed number of orbits, and only charges if action sent is idle.

### V3
Same as V0, but the satellite generates repeated paterens of Targets to simulate a satellite in a repeating ground track orbit.
