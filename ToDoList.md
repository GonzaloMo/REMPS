# Research branches
1. Hyperparameter tunning search for RL
   1. Ray tune (grid search)
   2. Calum meta-gradient search (online)

2. Reward functions:
   1. Simple world Plan-oriented (domain specific)
   2. Mapping between Genral domain Metrics to specific Reward functions 

3. Work on arbiter with NDAO and MA environments
   1. Hard coded Switch based on free time (Rule based on alpha(need other name))
   2. Alpha-Weighted Maximum value action taken 
   3. Full RL arbiter agent
      - Action input
      - Value action input
      - Merged
